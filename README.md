We’ve caught up on our list of TV shows and movies and want to get recommendations for what to watch next, but we aren't sure where to look.

## Installation

To use The Movie Database App, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There is no need to install any additional dependencies or software.

## Usage

In this project, we’ll use our knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a Movie Discovery App that will recommend Random Movies by genre. We’ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.
